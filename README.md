# BasicQuaternionMultCalc
A basic quaternion multiplication calculator.

### Quaternion math is very weird, and I am in no way qualified to explain it, but heres my understanding:
Quaternion (Q) math is mostly used in 3 dimensional rotation calculation.
In Q math, some fundamental rules of math are different.
For example, in normal math: `a ✖ b = b ✖ a`, but in Q math: `a ✖ b ≠ b ✖ a`.

### Here are some sources which I looked at and might be of use if you want to do something similar:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion                  
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html

https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348a-17-winter/Papers/quaternion.pdf                    

If you know more about Q math, please feel free to explain it better, or correct me anywhere I have made an error.
